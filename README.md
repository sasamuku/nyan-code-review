# üò∫ NyanCode Review üò∫

Your feline friend for code reviews! NyanCode Review is a GitHub App that analyzes PR code changes and provides feedback with cat-themed messages.

## Features

- **PR Change Analysis**: Automatically analyzes code changes when PRs are created or updated
- **Complexity Metrics**: Evaluates additions, deletions, changed files, and file type diversity
- **Cat-themed Feedback**: Provides fun, cat-themed messages based on PR complexity
- **Review Priority**: Visualizes review priority with a "cat scale" (üò∫√ó3)
- **Review Tips**: Offers helpful review suggestions based on PR size and complexity

## How It Works

1. When a PR is created or updated, GitHub sends a webhook event to NyanCode Review
2. The app analyzes the PR's code changes using various metrics
3. It calculates a complexity score and determines review priority
4. A cat-themed comment is posted on the PR with analysis results and review tips
